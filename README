Beginning
=====================================

This started as https://github.com/jamesward/play2bars-scala but has been modified extensively

It assumes that you have installed play can start it with

   > play

Value Addition
=====================================

Some tests, global settings, caching, async, streaming  were added. Logging was changed,etc.

Check the routes file for goodies.


Timing
=====================================

To show async in action see the functional utilities in Utils.scala and its usage in Application.pi().


Caution
=====================================

It seems like one can't run different types of tests in the same go .. you might see some

    IllegalStateException: cannot be started once stopped (HashedWheelTimer.java:259)

to see it uncomment ServerCachedPiSpec.

Heroku
=====================================

The project can also be deployed on Heroku thanks to the Procfile


Original Readme follows


Bar
=====================================

Bar application the best you can get!
